What is laravel?

Laravel is a popular open-source PHP framework used for building web applications. It follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which provides a structured approach to developing scalable and maintainable web applications.




I would Select a visualization library that suits your project requirements.
example Chart.js, D3.js, Plotly.js, and Google Charts. 


Install the Library: Depending on the library, you may need to install it via a package manager like npm or include it directly from a CDN.

Install the library via npm:
```
npm install chart.js --save
```

I would then create a chart.js file in the resources/js directory and add the following code to it:
```
import { Line } from 'vue-chartjs'

export default {
  extends: Line,
  mounted () {
    this.renderChart({
      labels: ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July'],
      datasets: [
        {
          label: 'Data One',
          backgroundColor: '#f87979',
          data: [40, 39, 10, 40, 39, 80, 40]
        }
      ]
    }, {responsive: true, maintainAspectRatio: false})
  }
}
```

For instance from the example above, I would then register the component globally in the resources/js/app.js file:
```
import Chart from './components/Chart'

Vue.component('line-chart', Chart)
```


Deployment to Vercel or Netlify

I would then deploy the application to Vercel or Netlify. I would then add the following code to the resources/views/welcome.blade.php file:
```

<div id="app">
  <line-chart></line-chart>
</div>

<script src="{{ mix('js/app.js') }}"></script>
```

I would then run the following command to compile the assets:
```
npm run dev
```


I would then run the following command to deploy the application to Netlify:
```
netlify deploy --prod
```
